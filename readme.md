TO LOOK AT THE CODE OPEN src FOLDER THAT CONTAINS THE SOURCE CODE WHEREAS THE dist FOLDER CONTAINS THE DISTRIBUTION FILES
I HAVE USED MVC (MODEL VIEWS CONTROL) ARCHITECTURE IN THIS PROJECT WHERE MY MODEL FILES ARE IN models FOLDER IN src FOLDER AND VIEWS FILES ARE IN views FOLDER IN src FOLDER
CONTROLLER FILE IS THE index.js IN src FOLDER

TO OPEN THIS PROJECT THERE ARE TWO METHODS
METHOD 1(RECOMMENDED)

1. OPEN POWERSHELL INTO THIS FOLDER BY HOLDING RIGHT SHIFT AND CLICKING RIGHT MOUSE
2. IN THE POWERSHELL WRITE 'npm install'
3. AS SOON AS IT'S DONE INSTALLING RUN THE COMMAND BY TYPING 'npm run start'
4. IT WILL RUN IN A BROWSER ON localhost:8080
   METHOD 2
5. GO TO DIST FOLDER AND SIMPLY RUN INDEX.HTML
